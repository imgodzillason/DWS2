                <h2>Where Did It All Start?</h2>

                <p>Zombies are fictional undead creatures, typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a
                    hunger for human flesh and/or brains. They are most commonly found in horror works and the term
                    comes from Haitian folklore where a zombie is a dead body reanimated by voodoo magic. Most
                    modern depictions of zombies do not usually involve magic to conjure the creatures, but instead
                    use methods akin to a virus outbreak. </p>

                <p>The modern concept of the zombies we know today can be attributed directly to George Romero's
                    1968 class, <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>. Using the zombie vehicle, Romero used his films
                    to criticize real-world issues, such as government ineptitude, bioengineering, slavery, greed,
                    and exploitation (Source:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).

                </div>

                <h2>Why the Fascination?</h2>

                <p>The fascination with zombies stems from a need to understand (or give a face to) the growing
                    concerns around us. We use zombies in a way that allows us to emotionally cope with the
                    devastation we see on a daily basis. Starting with the World Wars and coming to present day, we
                    are becoming more acutely aware of our mortality and the role outside forces play on us. Humanity
                    is no longer hopeful as they were during the Enlightenment or the Industrial Revolution. As

                    Angela Becarra Viergara </a>states in her doctoral dissertation, <em>Fictions of
                    Destruction:Post-1945 Narrative and Disaster in the Collective Imaginary</em>,events in the
                    20th century, along with movements to increase environmental awareness have left us with
                    doubts about the consequences of our development as a modernized society and "instead we are left
                    with this cultural fixation on fictionalizing our own death, very specifically mass-scale
                    destruction."

                <h2>Rising Popularity</h2>

                <p>Having covered reasons as to why this genre has made such an abundant leap into society, let's
                    take a look at the increasing popularity. We have books, graphic novels, movies, television shows,
                    video games,and toys everywhere. Max Brooks, author of <em>The Zombie Survival Guide</em> has
                    made a killing off zombie preparedness (the pun is terrible, I know.) We have Plants vs. Zombies,
                    a video game that pits you against zombies with nothing but plants to fend them off. The <em>Call
                    of Duty</em> series has made it a cornerstone of their games to include a nightmarishly difficult
                    zombie mode, but still manages to include a bit of comedy. Even <em>The Walking Dead</em>, which
                    started as a graphic novel, has moved into the forefront of popularity with record-breaking
                    viewership.</p>

                <h2>Pitfalls</h2>

                <p>With this increase of zombie media, we will eventually reach a point of oversaturation, wherein
                    we'll eventually become tired of the same tropes of impending doom and the apocalypse being just
                    around the corner. Personally, I don't mind the increasing popularity. It gives me more options
                    regarding film, television, books, and games. I enjoy sifting through the low budget, campy
                    zombie film to find that one gem that might have gotten overlooked.</p><br/>

                <p>And trust me, there are a lot of movies that should have remained dead. However, I've added some
                    of my favorites that you should definitely check out in case you haven't already. And if you
                    have? Check them out again!
