                <h2>Where Did It All Start?</h2>
                <p>Zombies are fictional undead creatures, typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a
                    hunger for human flesh and/or brains. They are most commonly found in horror works and the term
                    comes from Haitian folklore where a zombie is a dead body reanimated by voodoo magic. Most
                    modern depictions of zombies do not usually involve magic to conjure the creatures, but instead
                    use methods akin to a virus outbreak. </p>

                <p>The modern concept of the zombies we know today can be attributed directly to George Romero's
                    1968 class, <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>. Using the zombie vehicle, Romero used his films
                    to criticize real-world issues, such as government ineptitude, bioengineering, slavery, greed,
                    and exploitation. </p><br />

                <h2>Why the Fascination?</h2>
                <p>The fascination with zombies stems from a need to understand (or give a face to) the growing
                    concerns around us. We use zombies in a way that allows us to emotionally cope with the
                    devastation we see on a daily basis. Starting with the World Wars and coming to present day, we
                    are becoming more acutely aware of our mortality and the role outside forces play on us. Humanity
                    is no longer hopeful as they were during the Enlightenment or the Industrial Revolution. As
                    <a href="https://dlcl.stanford.edu/people/angela-m-becerra-vidergar?q=people/angela-m-becerra-vidergar">
                     Angela Becarra Viergara </a>states in her doctoral dissertation, <em>Fictions of
                     Destruction:Post-1945 Narrative and Disaster in the Collective Imaginary</em>,events in the
                     20th century, along with movements to increase environmental awareness have left us with
                     doubts about the consequences of our development as a modernized society and "instead we are left
                     with this cultural fixation on fictionalizing our own death, very specifically mass-scale
                     destruction."
