            <h2>The History</h2>

                <p>In folkloric tales, undead vampires often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths
                in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often
                described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt,
                pale vampire which dates from the early 1800s. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in
                most cultures, the term vampire was not popularised until the early 18th century, after an
                influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were
                frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by
                different names, such as <em>vrykolakas</em> in Greece and <em>strigoi</em> in Romania. This increased
                level of vampire superstition in Europe led to what can only be called mass hysteria and in some cases
                resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism. In modern
                times, however, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in
                similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early
                folkloric belief in vampires has been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of
                decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this,
                creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked
                with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely
                discredited.</p><br/>

                <p>The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with
                the publication of The Vampyre by John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably
                the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century. However, it is Bram Stoker's
                1897 novel Dracula which is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the
                basis of the modern vampire legend. The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire
                genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, and television shows. The vampire
                has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.</p>

            <h2>Film and Television</h2>

                <p>Considered one of the preeminent figures of the classic horror film, the vampire has proven
            to be a rich subject for the film and gaming industries. Dracula is a major character in more
            films than any other but Sherlock Holmes, and many early films were either based on the novel
            of Dracula or closely derived from it. These included the landmark 1922 German silent film
            Nosferatu, directed by F. W. Murnau and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although
            names and characters were intended to mimic Dracula's, Murnau could not obtain permission to do
            so from Stoker's widow, and had to alter many aspects of the film. In addition to this film was
            Universal's Dracula (1931), starring Béla Lugosi as the Count in what was the first talking
            film to portray Dracula. The decade saw several more vampire films, most notably Dracula's
            Daughter in 1936 (Source:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

            <h2>Music Video</h2>

                <p>The following video is a music video containing scenes from <em>The Lost Boys</em>, and iconic
                    vampire film from 1987 (and my personal favorite). The music is the epitome of the 1980s and is
                    the perfect match for the film. The original inspiration came from James Jeremias, who caught upon
                    the notion that Peter Pan could fly, visited Wendy and her brothers at night, and never grew old.
                    The simple notion that Peter Pan was a vampire was the genesis for the story. In the first draft of
                    the script, the character of David—later played by Kiefer Sutherland—was originally named Peter,
                    and other characters also had names from the Peter Pan story. In the final draft, many name changes
                    were made, but originally the two brothers were Michael and John (which was later changed to Sam)
                    and the mother's name was Wendy.(Source:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Boys" target="_blank">
                        Wikipedia</a>).
